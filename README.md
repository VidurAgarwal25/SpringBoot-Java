## Documentation

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my learning and hands-on experience with Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The primary focus of these projects includes building practical applications, working with databases, and creating responsive web interfaces.



Key Features:

1.) JPA Integration: Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with custom queries using JPA.
2.) RESTful APIs: Created multiple REST APIs with Spring Boot, utilizing @ResponseBody and @Controller annotations.
3.) Thymeleaf Templates: Used Thymeleaf for dynamic templating, with support for iteration, conditionals, and fragment management to build responsive user interfaces.
4.) Spring Boot DevTools: Set up Spring Boot DevTools to avoid restarting the application during testing, enhancing development efficiency.
5.) Dynamic resource paths using ClassPathResource & file upload handling with Spring Boot Returning file URLs for server access.
6.) Form handling with Spring MVC & Thymeleaf.
7.) Server-side validation using Hibernate Validator and javax.validation
8.) Conditional rendering and data validation
