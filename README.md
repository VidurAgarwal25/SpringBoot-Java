## Documentation

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my learning and hands-on experience with Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The primary focus of these projects includes building practical applications, working with databases, and creating responsive web interfaces.

Key Projects

1.) File Upload System in Spring Boot

In this project, I’ve developed a file upload feature in Spring Boot that allows users to upload files to the server. The application handles dynamic file paths and storage, and it returns URLs so users can access their files directly (e.g., http://localhost:8080/images/scenery.jpg).

Key Features:

Dynamic resource paths using ClassPathResource
File upload handling with Spring Boot Returning file URLs for server access.

2.) Form Handling & Server-Side Validation in Spring MVC

This project demonstrates form handling and server-side validation using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. I created a web form that performs server-side validation with Hibernate Validator and javax.validation annotations to ensure the data is clean and reliable.

Key Features:

Form handling with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf.
Server-side validation using Hibernate Validator and javax.validation
Conditional rendering and data validation
Additional Features & Technologies
This repository also includes various configurations and components to extend the functionality and demonstrate different Spring features:

JPA Integration: Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with custom queries using JPA.
RESTful APIs: Created multiple REST APIs with Spring Boot, utilizing @ResponseBody and @Controller annotations.
Thymeleaf Templates: Used Thymeleaf for dynamic templating, with support for iteration, conditionals, and fragment management to build responsive user interfaces.
Spring Boot DevTools: Set up Spring Boot DevTools to avoid restarting the application during testing, enhancing development efficiency.
